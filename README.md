Project Title
====================
_Author: Rahul Brahma <mrbrahma.rahul@gmail.org>_


Getting Started
---------------

To get started, type "make".


The Tips
--------
1. Use git and virtual environments. Always.
2. Good workflow trumps good tooling
3. Good workflow means not having to remember things
4. Use one virtual environment per git repo. Give them both the same name.
5. Maintain virtual environments as code.
6. Use Lockfiles: Separate "what you want" from "what you need".
7. Auto-document your workflow
8. Don't be afraid to "Nuke it from orbit"
